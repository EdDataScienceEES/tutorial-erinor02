In this tutorial, we will learn about various biodiversity matrices and how to calculate these using the `vegan` package. The key matrices we will cover are Shannons Diversity Index, Simpsons Index, Species 
richness and Species evenness. We will then cover how to visualise and present these patterns and then you can have a go with another data set to consolidate your learning.

## 1. Introduction to biodiversity matrices

Measuring Biodiversity is an important aspect of Community Ecology as it helps to understand ecosystem health and stability however it is a complex term which defines and includes: 
 - the number of species present in the community, ecosystem or globally
 - the evolutionary diversity represented by these species
 - the diverse communities and ecosystems these species build
 
As biological diversity is a complex term it can be measured in many different ways, one area often focused on is species diversity. The main methods used to assess species diversity are: 

1 - Species Richness measures
2 - General indices of species diversity 
3 - Species Evenness measures 

### 1 - Species Richness Measures
 
Species richness is the number of different species in a defined area and it is merely a numerical characteristic of a community. It doesn't incorporate the abundance of individual species found within the defined area or how evenly they are distributed. It is a simple measure that can useful to give an indication of the complexity of the ecosystem and it can be used to compare different communities. It is often expressed as S. 

### 2 - General indecies of species diversity 

There are several different species diversity indices that can be used. These indices are more complex and account for variation in both the number of species and the way that individuals within the community are distributed among species. These indecies of diversity incorporate richness, commonness and rarity (evenness).
