# Community Ecology - Biodiversity indices and Visualisation

By Erin O'Rourke

Nov 2024

## An introduction to calculating various Biodiversity indices using vegan and creating visualisations of these pattern

----
In this tutorial, we will learn about various biodiversity matrices and how to calculate these using the `vegan` package. The key matrices we will cover are Shannons Diversity Index, Simpsons Index, Species richness and Species evenness. We will then cover ways to visualise community data through simple boxplots,rank abundance curves followed by slightly more complex heat maps. Finally you can have a go with another data set to consolidate your learning.
